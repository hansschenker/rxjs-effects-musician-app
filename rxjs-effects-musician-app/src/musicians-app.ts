// We need to access the BehaviorSubject value, but we only exported `musiciansState$` (Observable) from state.ts.
// Let's modify state.ts to export the getter or we can just subscribe and take 1.
// Actually, for a synchronous getter, we need access to the underlying value.
// I'll update `src/store/musicians.state.ts` to export a `getCurrentState` helper if needed, or just cheat here if I can't change it easily.
// Checking `src/store/musicians.state.ts` content I wrote... I did not export `state$`, only `musiciansState$` as observable.
// But I exported selectors which use `state$.value`.
// So I can implement `getCurrentState` by composing selectors or just adding it to `state.ts`.
// I will just use the `select*` functions to reconstruct state or, better, update `state.ts` to export a `getStateSnapshot`.
// Reviewing my `state.ts` write... I did not export `state$` directly.
// But I do have `state$.value` usage in selectors.
// To implement `getCurrentState` efficiently, I should export a function from `state.ts`.
// I will rewrite `src/store/musicians.state.ts` to export `getStateSnapshot`.

export function getCurrentState(): MusiciansState {
  // Temporary implementation until I update state.ts
  // This is not ideal but avoids another file write unless necessary.
